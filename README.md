# ConsoleChatApp
This is a chat application I am building as part of my C++ Parallel and Distributed Programming learning <br>
This chat application will work in Windows environment but I will later add the Unix version, which is more straightforward<br>
Ideally this app will accept reppomte connection by a group of computers that will chat together passing message throu the server<br>
For the server no to be sitting as a  mere middle man, I will put some random decoration into the messages sent so that i feel the server at work
